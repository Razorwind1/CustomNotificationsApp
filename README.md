## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to make your own custom notifications on your phone? We're creating an app that will allow you to do just that! This simple app that allows for the following:
- Scheduling Notifications on a recurring basis (hourly, every few hours, daily, certain days of the week, every few weeks, or even a day of the year)
- Ability to have a randomly selected notification show from a group of notifications (eg: for custom rotating affirmations or prayers or quotes to memorize)
- Trigger notifications based on location (GPS)

_Use our app for self-improvement: set reminders throughout the day to direct your thought-life, write custom affirmations to speak truth into your morning, let a re-orienting notification trigger whenever you arrive at work, and help yourself memorize the quotes or facts that are most meaningful to you._

## Storyboard

Take a look at our [**interactive InVision storyboard**](https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/MobileDev-InVision-for-CustomNotificationsApp-ckkkf2htj0060wu01zxv8loji/play/a80f6ab0) to see our initial envisioning of the app!

We also have images of our storyboards (and the InVision file) in the [Storyboards folder](https://github.com/Razorwind1/CustomNotificationsApp/tree/Storyboards/storyboards) in the repo.

## Class Diagram

### Class Diagram Description

This is a diagram of the initial planned internal stucture of the application, with the classes, interfaces and databases. The dashed lines indicate that the relationship between the classes will be handled in the database with an intermediatary table in order to allow alarms and groups to be assigned to multiple attributes of one type, such as one alarm in two groups or three locations. The Place and Occurence classes are probably going to change because we want to outsource that to existing maps and calendar applications, which can also help users by being able to sync their alarms with their schedule or location history. So, we will modify them as we research mapping (ex. Google Maps) and calendar software APIs.
